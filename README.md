# Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis API for YouTube comments

## Project Goal

Development of a modular REST API in Python to analyze textual comments (primarily from YouTube) to identify common aspects and evaluate the sentiment polarity associated with each one. The solution will allow for understanding public opinion on different elements of a piece of content (audio, script, entertainment, etc.) without persistently storing sensitive information.

## Main Features

- **Aspect-based analysis**: Automatic identification of recurring themes and specific sentiment analysis for each aspect.
- **Overall analysis**: Evaluation of the global polarity of a set of comments.
- **Aspect extraction**: Identification and grouping of themes without sentiment analysis.
- **YouTube integration**: Automatic retrieval of comments from video URLs.
- **Direct analysis**: Processing of comment lists provided directly.

## Actual status
This project has just started and all bellow this is the planned structure and functions. It may change in the future
